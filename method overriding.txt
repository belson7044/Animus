>Method Overriding in Java<

	If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known 
as method overriding in Java.
	In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has 
been declared by one of its parent classit is known as method overriding.

Usage of Java Method Overriding
1. Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is 
already provided by its superclass.
2. Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for Java Method Overriding
1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

Example of method overriding:

class Vehicle{  
  //defining a method  
  void run(){System.out.println("Vehicle is running");}  
}  
//Creating a child class  
class Bike2 extends Vehicle{  
  //defining the same method as in the parent class  
  void run(){System.out.println("Bike is running safely");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  Bike2 obj = new Bike2();//creating object  
  obj.run();//calling method  
  }  
}
